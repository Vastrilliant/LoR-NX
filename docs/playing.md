# Playing

How to build and install a game: [README](../README.md#how-to-play).

- **Settings:** a screen before the game starts sets frame rate, resolution, docked or handheld mode, language, touch controls and more. Tap **Play**; your choices are remembered. What each one does: [Settings](settings.md).
- **Saves and logs** are in the Files app, under the game's name: `save/` and `log.txt` (the previous run is `log.prev.txt`). When something goes wrong, send `log.txt`.
- **Reinstalling:** some sideloading tools give a reinstalled app a new data folder. Copy `save/` and `pso_user.tsv` over from the old one to keep your progress.

## Touch controls

This fork has one touch layout, the swipe gamepad: swipes are the D-pad, a tap is A, a hold is B (or a dedicated B button, if you turn that setting on), and L, R, ZL, ZR, X, Y, − and + are outlined buttons. The right stick button is a scroller: hold it and move that finger up or down to scroll, or swipe with another finger while holding it to move the right stick. The default layout is the one the editor's **Reset** brings back. Place them in the launcher under Controls > Edit swipe controls layout. The 2D, 3D and Tap layouts and the layout button at the top centre are gone.

With **Touchscreen Mode** on (Controls; it turns the touch-ui mod on for you) the swipe gamepad is replaced by a trackpad and a keyboard. Drag one finger anywhere to move the cursor like a laptop trackpad; a tap is a left click, a second tap right on top of the first is a right click, touching and holding presses the left button until you lift, and swiping with three fingers holds the left button and drags until a finger lifts; the game gets all of it as a mouse, swiping up or down with two fingers scrolls, and pinching two fingers apart or together zooms (the mouse wheel, up when they spread), in both Pointer Modes. The combat page, key page, burning book and passive succession lists can also be scrolled by dragging them. **Pointer Mode** (Controls) switches this to **Touch**: the cursor is your finger (the game's own cursor is hidden), touching the screen presses the left button at once and lifting the finger lets it go, so holding and moving drags, and a second tap landing right on top of the first is a right click, with no wait to see whether it comes. In the default Trackpad mode a tap is a left click, a second tap on top of the first is a right click, and touching and holding for 0.45 seconds holds the left button until you lift. **Esc** sits at the top left, a thin **Space** bar at the bottom middle and **Shift**, **Ctrl** and **Alt** at the bottom left, in that order; each counts as held while a finger is on it (the thin bar takes touches over a taller strip than it is drawn), and **Alt** is also the button that mods use R3 for (Targetable Mass Attacks, Re-Extraction, Max Emotion). The keys are outlined like the swipe gamepad's buttons. Move, resize and fade them in the launcher under Controls > Edit touchscreen layout, as you do the swipe gamepad's; **Reset** there brings back the default places. Each click, scroll step and key press gives a haptic tap unless **Touch feedback** is off.

A connected game controller hides the touch controls and keeps every button.

## Rumble

Game vibration uses the iPhone's haptic engine or a compatible connected controller. Controllers with separate left/right haptic outputs keep those effects separate. It is always on and has no setting on the screen; `DM_RUMBLE`, `DM_RUMBLE_GAIN` and `DM_RUMBLE_MIN` in `Documents/env.txt` still change it ([env switches](env_switches.tsv)). Phone rumble approximates the Switch's effects; physical feel and controller compatibility still need device testing.

## Motion (gyro)

A controller that supplies gyro data through Apple's controller support (DualSense, DualShock 4) drives the game's motion controls, on the Mac and the iPhone: aiming and tilt puzzles in games that read the controller's motion, such as Breath of the Wild with its Motion Controls option on. A controller without one (Backbone One, Razer Kishi and other controllers the phone mounts in) uses the iPhone's own gyro, as a Switch in handheld. Motion follows the controller in docked mode, the default.

`DM_PHONE_MOTION=0` in `Documents/env.txt` stops the phone's gyro, `DM_MOTION=0` all motion. If motion misbehaves, pack with `--no-motion` (`MOTION = False` in Spyder) for an app without it; `DM_MOTION=1` in `Documents/env.txt` turns it back on.

Switch Pro Controller gyro on the Mac still needs the HID support being developed in [PR #296](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/pull/296).

**Shaking.** Shake the iPhone to shake the controller, in games that read its motion: Super Mario Odyssey's motion moves (such as the cap throw on a shake) need it, and Odyssey only takes them in its default docked mode. A light bump does not count; a sharp flick of the phone does.

## Game language

English by default. Pick another when packing with `--language` (`-l`), by code or by name: `-l ja`, `-l zh-Hans`, `-l French` (`LANGUAGE` in Spyder). It must be one the game has; the script prints the game's languages and stops on one it lacks. To change it without rebuilding, pick another on the settings screen.

## Settings in a file

Lines like `DM_OPMODE=0` (handheld mode: lower resolution, higher frame rate) in `Documents/env.txt` win over the settings screen, which then shows them greyed out ([the full list](settings.md#settings-in-a-file)). `DM_FPS_TARGET=30` keeps Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, Octopath Traveler 0 and Octopath Traveler II at their original 30 fps, which saves battery; `DM_PRESENT_INTERVAL=game` does the same for Monster Train 2. `DM_SHOW_FPS=1` shows the frame rate at the top left (`--show-fps` when packing turns it on from the start). `DM_LAUNCHER=0` skips the settings screen.

## On the Mac

A Mac app shows the game's settings in a window before the game starts ([The Mac settings window](settings.md#the-mac-settings-window)). Its `env.txt` is `~/Library/Application Support/nxnative/<title ID>/env.txt`, and its log is `~/Library/Logs/nxnative/<title ID>.log`. [NX2Apple](https://github.com/LNPANDY/NX2Apple)'s library can also start it with the settings you pick there.

## Shaders on first sight

Short stutters the first time a new scene appears are normal: the app compiles graphics for it once and remembers them for the next launch. What it remembered, and what the game's list names, is built before the game starts, behind "Preparing shaders" and a progress bar when that takes more than half a second.
