// LauncherAudio: the launcher's music and its Play sound (Launcher.swift). iOS only (the Mac settings window does not use it).
// The music loops while the launcher is up. Play stops the music at once and rolls the dice, which play out, while the game starts at once: nothing waits for the audio.
// So the audio outlives the launcher view (one shared instance), and its timer runs on its own queue, not the main one, which the game's start may keep busy.
// The audio session is left alone on purpose: main.m has already set it up for the game (front_ios_audio_session), and changing its category here would carry over into the game.
// Files (dm/ios/Resources, bundled by project.yml): LauncherBGM.m4a (the first 1:30 of the track), LauncherDiceRoll.wav and SaveSlots/BookBurn.mp3 (the Saves menu's confirm sound). A missing file just means no sound, never a stuck launcher.
