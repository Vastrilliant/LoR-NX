// Virtual gamepad (Nintendo button positions) + physical controllers (GameController), handed to the host through dm_input_set and dm_pad_set_player (hle_hid.c, bit layout in dm_input.h).
//   One layout: Swipe. The 2D, 3D and Tap layouts and the layout button at the top centre were removed; the code of those layouts is still below but unreachable.
//   Swipe: the swipe gamepad of GesturePad.swift over the whole screen (swipes are the D-pad, a tap is A, a hold is B; L, R, ZL, ZR, X, Y, − and + are outlined buttons, with toggles for the right stick and for repeating swipes),
//     placed by the launcher's layout editor (Launcher.swift, GestureLayoutEditor.swift). It presses through dm_gesture_button / dm_gesture_stick, below.
//   2D (simple): top corners ZL above L (one column), ZR above R likewise, teardrops with the tip toward the screen corner; − and + side by side at the top centre; the left stick in the bottom-left corner (fixed ring, tilt measured from the ring centre, small dead zone);
//     the A (right) B (bottom) X (top) Y (left) diamond in the bottom-right corner, sliding a finger between keys switches keys. Each bottom corner holds a single control, so it sits close in (reaching halfway into the side safe-area inset).
//   3D (full, Pro Controller style): everything in 2D (left stick and diamond keep their place and size), plus a D-pad (inward of and below the left stick, 8-way), a right stick that is not drawn
//     (a touch landing in the right third of the screen on no control holds it: centred where it lands, the centre dragged along once the finger passes the stick radius) and L3 / R3 (small round keys in the top row, inward of ZL / ZR).
//     Breath of the Wild crouches with L3 and uses the scope with R3; 3D World and Breath of the Wild turn the camera with the right stick.
//   Touch-down ownership: locked keys first (shoulders, − / +, the layout button, L3 / R3), then whichever of the diamond, the D-pad and the left stick has the smallest distance / grab radius (the left stick's grab circle borders the D-pad),
//     then in 3D the right stick for a touch in the right third.
//   Everything hugs the edges and corners to leave the picture room; controls sit over the picture, one CAShapeLayer each: a press only swaps the fill, a stick only moves its knob, nothing redraws the whole screen.
//   Touches no control takes (in 3D, those outside the right third) go to the game's touch screen (pushGame; Super Mario Galaxy's pointer in handheld mode).
//   The virtual gamepad (layout button included) hides while a physical controller is connected and comes back when it is removed; meanwhile every touch goes to the game. Physical controllers keep every button (D-pad and right stick included) and map by position: bottom = B, right = A, left = Y, top = X (same positions as on a Switch controller); a Nintendo pad maps by its labels (pad_apple.h).
//   Each physical controller is a player of its own (local co-op), as on the Mac: the first one connected is player 1, together with the touch gamepad, the next player 2, and so on up to 8; see "Physical controllers" below.
//   Touchscreen Mode (DM_TOUCHSCREEN=1) replaces all of it: the screen is a touchpad for the game's mouse (tsBegan below: one finger drags the cursor, a tap is the left button, a hold presses the left button until the finger lifts, three fingers swiping hold the left button, two fingers moving up or down scroll the wheel and pinching zooms it;
//     (Pointer Mode Touch, DM_POINTER_MODE=touch, puts the cursor under the finger instead: touch down = left button down, lift = left button up, moving in between drags; the touch-ui mod then hides the game's own cursor)
//     the app draws no cursor: the game's own is moved by the mouse; the left click reaches the game as a touch-screen press at the cursor, since the touch-ui mod makes the game read the touch screen: hle_touch.c trackpad_touch) and Esc and Alt are the keyboard's keys (front.h dm_mouse_*, dm_key_modifier, dm_key_press), drawn as the textures TouchKeyEsc.png and TouchKeyAlt.png (Resources, bundled by project.yml), each pinned to a screen corner and not movable: Esc at the top left, Alt (the texture mirrored) at the bottom left, each as wide as the bar the 16:9 picture leaves at that side of the screen
//     so neither reaches into the picture. Clicks, scroll steps and the keys give a haptic tap while DM_TOUCH_HAPTICS is on.
//   Shaking the phone shakes the controller (DM_BTN_SHAKE: its six-axis sensor, hle_hid.c), whichever controls are in use; see "Shaking the phone" below.

// ---- Touchscreen Mode: touchpad and keyboard ----

// touching down presses the left button at once and lifting lets it go, so holding and moving drags. When no finger is down the cursor is parked off the panel (dm_mouse_park), so nothing stays hovered.
// The touches that land on a key hold it (locked at touch-down, like the gamepad's keys): Esc or Alt, pinned to the screen corners (tsKeyFrame:); every other touch is the touchpad. One finger (Trackpad): it moves the cursor once it has left the slop; lifting it unmoved is a left click, and holding it unmoved for K_TP_HOLD presses the left button until it lifts. Three fingers swiping hold the left button and drag until one lifts. A second finger ends all of that (a button the first finger holds is let go, without a click in Touch mode) and makes the pair a wheel: their mid point's vertical travel
// turns into notches (down = wheel up, as dragging a page down shows what is above); their distance changing is a zoom, also the wheel (spread = wheel up), and only the one that travels further counts; the gesture stays over until every finger has lifted. Each click, each notch and each key press gives a haptic tap. A third finger does nothing.
